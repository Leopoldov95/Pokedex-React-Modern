## General Info
This is my full featured ReactJS Pokedex web app. This pokedex shows all current Pokemon as of Generation 8 and includes all forms and variations (such as mega evolutions, alolan, galar, and G-Max). This app has an eavy to use navbar and a searchbar to look for a specific Pokemon. The goal of this project was to learn more about the tool and feautres of ReactJS and to learn more about Web Development. I definetely had a lot of fun and frustration creating this app but I am quite happy with the result.

## What I Learned
This is my second version of creating a ReactJS Pokedex. The first version was functional but had a less appealing UI and had some minor bugs. For this version I used better images for the Pokedex and display the Pokemon types using custom icons and making the background color dynamic. I also used some of the more modern features of ReactJS such as hooks and react-router to really make this app more user friendly and deliver a nicer User Experience. It was defintely challenging learning how to use ReactJS, but it was very rewarding and I'm quite proud of how this version of the Pokedex turned out.
